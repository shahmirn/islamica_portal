## CSS
CSS is processed using [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/). This processor provides features such as auto-prefixing and future friendly CSS capabilities like CSS custom-properties (variables). CSS is also linted with Stylelint, using [wikimedia-stylelint-config](https://github.com/wikimedia/stylelint-config-wikimedia). CSS is divided into a ‘main’ `style.css` file and 'partials', which are CSS files starting with an underscore that get imported into the main CSS file. Imports are done using [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import). This plugin allows us to create a “SASS” style CSS structure, with many partials and one main file. It  also allows us to import styles from npm modules, such as the variables defined in [wikimedia-ui-base.css](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/source/wikimedia-ui-base/browse/master/wikimedia-ui-base.css) .

Processed CSS is outputted to the `dev/islamica.org/assets/css` folder for development. For production, the CSS is minified and **inlined** into the `index.html` file to reduce HTTP requests. A special CSS related file, `sprite-template.mustache` is also defined in `dev/islamica.org/assets/css`. This file is the template for the SVG image sprite, which uses CSS backgrounds to place images on the wikipedia.org page. The sprite template is compiled into a `sprite.css` file and outputted to the same directory. It is also minified and inlined for production purposes.
