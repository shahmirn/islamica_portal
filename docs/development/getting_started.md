## Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- Node v6.11 or greater
- NPM v3.8 or greater

To download all dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

### Starting a development server

**The portals repo does not provide a developement server**. To view changes you make while developing, you will need to run an HTTP server pointing to the root of this repository. This can be as easy as running one of the following commands from the root directory of the portals repository.

Starting a python simple server:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Or starting a PHP server:

```
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Then, you should be able to access the development directory at `http://localhost:8080/dev/islamica.org` and the production directory at `http://localhost:8080/prod/wikipedia.org`.

### Watching for changes

To watch for changes while you're developing, run:

```
gulp watch --portal=wikipedia.org
```

This will watch for changes in `dev/islamica.org` and recompile the HTML/CSS/JS and images if they change. The changes will be visible when then browser is reloaded.

### Updating Stats
To download the latest stats (article-counts and page-views) for the portal pages, run:

```
gulp update-stats
```

After that task completes, the next time you run the watch command the wikipedia.org dev page will be updated with the latest stats.
